# Hackathon Caetano Bus - BD2Interface </br> Production Planning Database Management

## Project Overview
This project, developed during the **CaetanoBus × 42 Porto Hackathon (July 22-26, 2024)**, aims to create a robust interface for managing production planning and control data at CaetanoBus. The project focuses on improving the accessibility and usability of production data to enhance decision-making and operational efficiency.

### Key Features:  
- **Database Management**: Organizes and simplifies access to production planning data, facilitating better data distribution and usage.
- **PEP and Project Creation**: Manages the creation of PEPs (Project Execution Plans) and new models/projects based on incoming orders.
- **Log Tracking**: Tracks and logs changes to planning files, allowing easy analysis of recurring delays and reporting on changes.
- **User Interface (UI)**: A React-based front-end for data visualization, model management, and PEP creation, designed for intuitive user interaction.
- **Automation**: Reduces manual intervention by automatically updating the database with changes to planning data and exporting monthly reports.
- **Improve Data Management**: Enhance the structure and access of the database for better data analysis and reporting.
- **Track Changes**: Implement a system to log and track data changes in real-time, aiding in error detection and delay management.

## Technology Stack
### Back-End:
- **Django**: Powers the backend to manage data storage and access.
- **SQLite**: Database management to handle planning and production data.
### Front-End:
- **React**: The UI for interacting with the database, allowing users to create and manage production plans, models, and projects easily.

## Current Status
- **Reduced Dependence on Excel**: The current solution minimizes the reliance on manual Excel files.
- **Data Integration**: Improved integration with other departments and services for seamless data sharing.
- **Simplify User Interaction**: Provide an easy-to-use interface to manage data entry, analysis, and reporting for production planning.
- **Automation**: Introduced automatic data updates to the database, reducing manual work.

## Next Steps
- **Optimize Update Times**: Reduce the time needed to update production data.
- **Integrate Remaining Planning Data**: Fully implement the remaining planning data for comprehensive analysis.
- Implement **on-site server solutions** to manage production plans and ensure continuous improvement of the system.
